# Serverless Web Application on AWS

## Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

### Project Description:

In this project, I built a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to read, update items from a DynamoDB table.

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. 
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. 
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. 

### Outcome:

Upon completing the project, I had a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
This project helped me improve my skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
